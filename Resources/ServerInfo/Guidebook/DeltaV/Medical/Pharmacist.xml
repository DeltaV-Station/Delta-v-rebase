# Pharmacist
The "crème de la crème" in terms of knowledge in chemistry, the Pharmacist is the best at its domain! Their valuable knowledge is to be respected.
They sacrifice the general purpose of Chemistry to the indomitable world of pharmaceutics, working more closely with the crew, the psychologist, medical doctors who actually do check-ups, and atmospheric technicians, ...
Social interactions are needed if you wish to excel and become a professional at handing out prescriptions.

## You're on your own!

The Pharmacist runs his own booth, where people can check out or ask for a prescription. You are a store-keep in some way.
Use your lab's design to your advantage, having a storefront, and a lab behind it!

## Prescriptions

The Pharmacist has access to unique items, his own stamp, and prescriptions.

Write your prescription template, hand it out to doctors, stamp it for legal reasons, and make copies! Your job is half-reagent half-paperwork! What a nightmare!
Your PDA has a built-in scanner, so don't worry about rushing to Medbay and asking what's wrong with someone.

## Pharmaceutic Reagents

Many of the reagents the Pharmacist has to deal with are hard to synthesize, a lot of them need a lot of refining, and overall a lot of resources, so try to be as noble and humble on your dosage, or harass logistics for more!
